What I thought was expensive, was my ipad air 2, I decided I didn’t need it anymore and could do with the cash to buy a shed, (Ohh how things have changed). Anyway I listed it and got some bids and it sold for about the average price that I would expect. Then the charges began, £12 to Pay Pal, £27 to Ebay and the item that was worth around £270 dropped to £230 in my pocket. You have got to expect charges and everyone wants their cut but this seemed a bit excessive. I have lots of other items I want to sell but don’t want to give some american giant all my money.</p><h3>So the idea</h3><p>Only sell authentic items (This will be a separate issue on its own). To start with no charges except for the payment to pay pal. Photography of item has to be on point. High personal customer service.</p><p>So what to do about it, I can write a bit of front end code that can now power the front and back end. I am a UX designer so can plan, research and design the user experience. I can also do a bit of UI design so why not give this problem some thought.</p><p>First thing I did was a massive mistake. I decided to create a beast of a app that has a massive list of features and functionality. So began the journey.</p><h3>Feature list</h3><p>I started out thinking of every possible feature that the user could want. Login, search products, product categories, post products, receive messages from users, take payment, authentic users and their products. I don’t even think this was the end of the list. It was a beast.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>I left out the user research, my idea was that I would base it all on assumptions and competitive research of products like Ebay. I dived straight into sketch (I can design this as I go and think of the user journeys on the fly, or so I thought). The design was under way and I then wanted to code.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>I fired up atom set up a repo and started to code. I got a simple login sorted, with users and product list. I added categories and pulled in products to the home page. I got a working build together of some key areas. Then I thought the design is not crap, I need to revist sketch as new bits popped into my head so I carried on.</p><h2>Stop!!!!</h2><p>I had fallen into the trap that I had heard about and thought “That would never be me”. I was designing as I went and building at the same time, I can do UX “or so I thought” as I go, no usability testing. Then when it went live no one wants to use a product if i don’t have a large customer base already, or no one knows about it. I was using React.js, Meteor as my app engine and Mongo databases to hold data. I had a login area and you could post products it was all going so well in my head. Then I got bored the doubt creep in and I shelved the idea for several months.</p><p>I was doing everything the “correct way” at work. Usability testing, user testing, transaction and user flows. Agile processes so why wasn’t I doing this on my own project? Good question.</p><p>I read a book by jamie levey[link] that inspired me to pick up the project again but adjust my process. The things I took out of this amazing book.</p><p>1: User test early and ofter (how would i do this without a product or so I thought) 2: Get it in peoples hands as early as possible. 3: Amazon, Uber, google etc all started out doing one thing and doing it well and adding features later. The example she gave was of a product that similar to mine had no users, was feature bloated and the development time was holding up the release and testing. 4: Create something simple even if you have to manage it yourself without powerful back ends and messaging systems, and process one product and transaction at a time. 5: Create a buzz make it exclusive. 6: Get as mush user data as you can.</p><h3>My new plan</h3><p>1: Narrow down to one product type, with no charges (except paypal). 2: Instead of opening it up to hundreds of products just sell one at a time and one of my items or someone I know. 3: Handle all correspondences via email no need for time intensive messaging systems. 4: Put one high end item up for sale, make it a timed sale to create interest. 5: Let people sign up to email notifications and request to sell their item, gathers potential users and information to promote later. 6: Once I have enough people wanting to sell their item, open it up to them. Again only keep it to one item so its exclusive and will create a unique personal experience. 7: Gather user research on this MVP. Do people want to use it? How are people using it. 8: Refine and perfect the experience. 9: Once selling one product is going well, start to sell multiple products. 10: Start to charge a low percentage so use the service. 1 or 2 percent. (This is how it will start to make money)</p><h2>Step one</h2><p>Step one will be refining the MVP down creating some user flows and making everything based on assumptions. [link]</p><h2>Step two</h2><p>Build out the simple product statically and manage it only yourself [link to come]</p><h2>Step three</h2><p>Gather sheds loads of user data. Google analytics, surveys, hotjar, usability testing etc. [link to come]</p><h2>Step four</h2><p>Analysis data and create usability maps of real data. [link to come]</p><h2>Step five</h2><p>UX design and adjust [link to come]</p><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>(function() { // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
