What I thought was expensive, an ipad air 2. I decided I didn’t need it anymore and could do with the cash to buy a shed, (Ohh how things have changed). I listed it and got some bids, it sold for about the average price expected.</p><p>Then the charges began, £12 to PayPal, £27 to Ebay, the item that was worth around £270 resulted in £230 in my pocket. You have got to expect charges and everyone wants their cut but this seemed a bit excessive. I have lots of other items I want to sell but don’t want to give some American giant all my money.</p><h3>So the idea</h3><p>Only sell authentic items. No charges except for the payment except to pay pal. Photography of item has to be on point. High personal customer service.</p><p>So what to do about it, I can write front end code that can now power the front and back end. I am a UX designer, so can plan, research and design the user experience. I can also do a bit of UI design so why not give this problem some thought.</p><p>I decided to create a beast of a app that has a massive list of features and functionality. So began the journey.</p><h3>Feature list</h3><p>I started out thinking of every possible feature that the user could want. Login, search products, product categories, post products, receive messages from users, take payment, authentic users and their products. I don’t even think this was the end of the list.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>I left out the user research, my idea was that I would base it all on assumptions and competitive research of products like Ebay. I dived straight into sketch (I can design this as I go and think of the user journeys on the fly, or so I thought). The design was under way and I then wanted to code.</p><h3>Development</h3><p>I fired up atom set up a repo and started to code. I got a simple login sorted, with users and product list. I added categories and pulled in products to the home page. I got a working build together of some key areas. Then I thought the design needed some work and jumped into sketch as new bits popped into my head so I carried on.</p><h2>Stop!!!!</h2><p>I had fallen into the trap that I had heard about and thought “That would never be me”. I was designing as I went and building at the same time, I can do UX as I go,and test at the end. I was using React.js, Meteor as my app engine and Mongo databases to hold data. I had a login area and you could post products it was all going so well in my head. Then I got bored, had some doubts like “no one wants to use a product if i don’t have a large customer base already” or no one knows about it. The doubt creep in and I shelved the idea for several months.</p><p>I was doing everything the “correct way” at work, usability testing, research, analysis, UX design, transaction and user flows. So why wasn’t I doing this on my own project? Good question.</p><p>I read a book by <a href="http://userexperiencestrategy.com/">UX Strategy</a> that inspired me to pick up the project again but adjust my process. I also read Lean UX <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-UX-Applying-Principles-Experience/dp/1449311652">Lean UX</a> and I started to have some new ideas and ways to market.</p><h3>The things I took out of these amazing books.</h3><ol><li>User test early and often.</li><li>Get it in people’s hands as early as possible.</li><li>Amazon, Uber, google etc all started out doing one thing and doing it well and adding features later. (The example given in Jamie’s book was of a product that similar to mine had no users, was feature bloated and the development time was holding up the release and testing).</li><li>Create something simple even if you have to manage it yourself without powerful back ends and messaging systems, and process one product and transaction at a time.</li><li>Create a buzz make it exclusive.</li><li>Get a MVP out as quickly as possible.</li><li>Get as data as you can from this MVP.</li><li>Iterate and develop.</li></ol><h3>My new plan</h3><ol><li>Narrow down to one product type, with no charges (except paypal).</li><li>Instead of opening it up to hundreds of products just sell one at a time..</li><li>Handle all correspondences via email no need for time intensive messaging systems.</li><li>Put one high end item up for sale, make it a timed sale to create interest.</li><li>Let people sign up to email notifications and request to sell their item, gathers potential users and information to promote later.</li><li>Once I have enough people wanting to sell their item, open it up to them. Again only keep it to one item so its exclusive and will create a unique personal experience.</li><li>Gather user research on this MVP. Do people want to use it? How are people using it.</li><li>Refine and perfect the experience.</li></ol><h3>How to make it profitable.</h3><ol><li>Start to sell multiple products.</li><li>Start to charge a low percentage to use the service. 1 or 2 percent. (This is how it will start to make money)</li></ol><h1>Follow the journey</h1><h2>Step one</h2><p>Step one will be refining the MVP down creating some user flows and making everything based on assumptions. Do as much research as I can to get a MVP into people’s hands. <a href="">link coming soon</a></p><h2>Step two</h2><p>Build out the MVP statically and manage it myself. <a href="">link coming soon</a></p><h2>Step three</h2><p>Gather sheds loads of user data. Google analytics, surveys, hotjar, usability testing etc. <a href="">link coming soon</a></p><h2>Step four</h2><p>Analysis data and create usability maps of real data. <a href="">link coming soon</a></p><h2>Step five</h2><p>Revisit UX design and adjust. <a href="">link coming soon</a></p><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>(function() { // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
