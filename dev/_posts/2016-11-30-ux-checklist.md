### User research
All design decisions on this project have been based on research conducted with our users

### Problem defined
Based on our research, we have defined a clear end-user problem that our product or feature will solve

### Mental Model
Our design aligns with our users' mental models of the service or product

### Perceivable and predictable
At all times, it's clear what users are being asked to do, and what will happen when they do it

### Feedback
Users are given helpful information at helpful times. Users are told when an event occurs, why it has occurred, and what they need to do if it requires fixing.

### Common conventions
Unless explicitly decided otherwise, our interface controls follow common conventions

### Affordances
We are using digital affordances naturally, to clarify how our product should be used.

### Deprioritise edge cases
The design is optimised for what most people do most of the time.

### Usability test
We have tested a prototype of the product for usability issues. We are adjusting the design accordingly
