Design thinking has been around since the 1940s when engineers, architects and businesses struggled to keep up with the ever changing technology and the way people interacted with new innovations. Over the next 80 years it has helped lots of different industrys overcome "wicked problems"(a term created by Horst Rittel to discribe complex problems that could have different solutions).

It consists of a set of guidelines to emphasis and learn about you user, define the problem, ideate to design the solution, prototype one or more solutions then test and repeat. It is a collaborative method that relies on people from different disciplines and backgrounds to bounce of each other and get a joint understanding of the problem and come up with solutions. At its core its a Human centered approach to understanding the user and prototyping and testing solutions and building on findings until you have something new that you would not of discoverd on your own, collaboration is key.

More recently it was initiated by [David Kelly](https://www.ideo.com/people/david-kelley) who helped Steve Jobs design several apple products and he set up a department at stanford [here is a virtual crash course](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources-collections/a-virtual-crash-course-in-design-thinking) called dSchool. He also set up the agency [ideo](https://www.ideou.com/) which uses these guidelines to innovate products, businesses and creative. It involves applying human centered design to all aspects of business and life.
