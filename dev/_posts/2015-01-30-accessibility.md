Accessibility goes hand in hand with user experience. As developers its something that needs to be considered as you build your product.

###Things to include
* [Skip nav ](http://accessibility.psu.edu/skipnav/)
  * Give your screen readers the option to skip the navigation. No one wants on hear that on every page load.
* [ARIA and Land Marks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_landmarks_to_identify_regions_of_a_page),
* role="button"
* role="link"
* role="radio"
* role="checkbox"

* [Don't turn divs and spans into link](http://www.karlgroves.com/2013/05/14/links-are-not-buttons-neither-are-divs-and-spans/)

* Use the focus pseudo to aid screen readers and users
