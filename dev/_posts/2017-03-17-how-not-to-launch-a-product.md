 The story of "Name to come" its beginnings and how its began and how I approach the agile product launch and lean UX
---
It began when I was selling an expensive item on Ebay. What I thought was expensive, was my ipad air 2, I decided I didn't need it anymore and could do with the cash to buy a shed, (Ohh how things have changed). Anyway I listed it and got some bids and it sold for about the average price that I would expect. Then the charges began, £12 to Pay Pal, £27 to Ebay and the item that was worth around £270 dropped to £230 in my pocket. You have got to expect charges and everyone wants their cut but this seemed a bit excessive. I have lots of other items I want to sell but don't want to give some american giant all my money.

### So the idea
Only sell authentic items (This will be a separate issue on its own). To start with no charges except for the payment to pay pal. Photography of item has to be on point. High personal customer service.

So what to do about it, I can write a bit of front end code that can now power the front and back end. I am a UX designer so can plan, research and design the user experience. I can also do a bit of UI design so why not give this problem some thought.

First thing I did was a massive mistake. I decided to create a beast of a app that has a massive list of features and functionality. So began the journey.

### Feature list
I started out thinking of every possible feature that the user could want. Login, search products, product categories, post products, receive messages from users, take payment, authentic users and their products. I don't even think this was the end of the list. It was a beast.

### Design
I left out the user research, my idea was that I would base it all on assumptions and competitive research of products like Ebay. I dived straight into sketch (I can design this as I go and think of the user journeys on the fly, or so I thought). The design was under way and I then wanted to code.

### Development
I fired up atom set up a repo and started to code. I got a simple login sorted, with users and product list. I added categories and pulled in products to the home page. I got a working build together of some key areas. Then I thought the design is not crap, I need to revist sketch as new bits popped into my head so I carried on.


## Stop!!!!
I had fallen into the trap that I had heard about and thought "That would never be me". I was designing as I went and building at the same time, I can do UX "or so I thought" as I go, no usability testing. Then when it went live no one wants to use a product if i don't have a large customer base already, or no one knows about it. I was using React.js, Meteor as my app engine and Mongo databases to hold data. I had a login area and you could post products it was all going so well in my head. Then I got bored the doubt creep in and I shelved the idea for several months.

I was doing everything the "correct way" at work. Usability testing, user testing, transaction and user flows. Agile processes so why wasn't I doing this on my own project? Good question.

I read a book by jamie levey[link] that inspired me to pick up the project again but adjust my process. The things I took out of this amazing book.

1: User test early and ofter (how would i do this without a product or so I thought)
2: Get it in peoples hands as early as possible.
3: Amazon, Uber, google etc all started out doing one thing and doing it well and adding features later. The example she gave was of a product that similar to mine had no users, was feature bloated and the development time was holding up the release and testing.
4: Create something simple even if you have to manage it yourself without powerful back ends and messaging systems, and process one product and transaction at a time.
5: Create a buzz make it exclusive.
6: Get as mush user data as you can.

### My new plan

1: Narrow down to one product type, with no charges (except paypal).
2: Instead of opening it up to hundreds of products just sell one at a time and one of my items or someone I know.
3: Handle all correspondences via email no need for time intensive messaging systems.
4: Put one high end item up for sale, make it a timed sale to create interest.
5: Let people sign up to email notifications and request to sell their item, gathers potential users and information to promote later.
6: Once I have enough people wanting to sell their item, open it up to them. Again only keep it to one item so its exclusive and will create a unique personal experience.
7: Gather user research on this MVP. Do people want to use it? How are people using it.
8: Refine and perfect the experience.
9: Once selling one product is going well, start to sell multiple products.
10: Start to charge a low percentage so use the service. 1 or 2 percent. (This is how it will start to make money)

## Step one
Step one will be refining the MVP down creating some user flows and making everything based on assumptions.

## Step two
Build out the simple product statically and manage it only yourself

## Step three
Gather sheds loads of user data. Google analytics, surveys, hotjar, usability testing etc.

## Step four
Analysis data and create usability maps of real data.

## Step five
UX design and adjust
