 Step 3 in the journey. This is where start to define flows and interactions.

If your not up to speed read this [how the journey started](/ux/2017/03/17/how-not-to-launch-a-product.html) first. This is step 2 in my process of creating a MVP with the objective to test the market, and get some genuine user data.

This step is to use the information we have defined in the previous step to start to sketch out and plan, user flows, features and content. Then iterate and have group discussions on solutions. However as its only me I will have to rely of data from my MVP.

### Sketches

Using all of the information I discovered in the define stage I started to sketch out possible solutions and potential user flows.

### Interaction flow

This is the interaction flow and wireframe for the buyer persona showing how the user reaches his goals for each story
