 Step 3 in the journey. Iterate and come up with new ideas and solutions using the problem statement and "how might we" questions we can start to think of solutions.

If your not up to speed read this [how the journey started](/ux/2017/03/17/how-not-to-launch-a-product.html) first. This is step 3 in my process of creating a MVP with the objective to test the market, and get some genuine user data.

This step is to iterate and come up with new ideas and solutions using the problem statement and "how might we" questions we can start to think of solutions. I already have a rough idea of features that we need from the affinity diagram and define section. If this wasn't a sole project I would conduct a workshop now and start to push for new innovative ways to tackle this problem [using this workshop outline](http://willforsyth.co.uk/ux/2017/07/14/running-idea-generation-workshop.html).
