If you are involved in the initial meeting with a client after, try to get them involved as possible.

###What to say to get the clients involved.

We would like the stakeholders and those involved in the project to outline who they think the users are and some short tasks.

###What we are trying to achieve.
* Represent a major user group for your website.
* Express and focus on the major needs and expectations of the most important user groups.
* Give a clear picture of the user's expectations and how they're likely to use the site.
* Describe real people with backgrounds, goals, and values.

### 1) Write out personas
Ask them to fill in a document of who they think the main users are for the site? Give them three to fill in using the template below.

> "As part of our research we will be looking into user personas. The purpose of personas is to create reliable and realistic representations of your key audience segments for reference".

####User
* User background:
* Name:
* Age:
* Highest education level:
* Professional background:

What are their interests?

Why would they be using the site and what are they trying to achieve?

Where and how will they access the site?

Do they have any special requirements when accessing the site?


### 2) Get them to design the home page
Next ask them to write out 5 things that rated in importance of what they would want to feature on the home page.

### 3) Ask them to rate user stories.
Before you go to the meeting fill in as many user stories as you can related to the site. Write these out on cards and get the shareholders and project leads to rate them in importance.

** As a ........... I want to .................. **


### 4) Rate resources
Print out a site map and get them to rate what to keep and what they would want to remove from the existing site. If they don't have a website then write out as many resources as you can and rate these in the meeting.
