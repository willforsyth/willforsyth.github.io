 Step 2 in the journey. This is where we collect all our findings and define our POV and how might we statements.

If your not up to speed read this [how the journey started](/ux/2017/03/17/how-not-to-launch-a-product.html) first. This is step 2 in my process of creating a MVP with the objective to test the market, and get some genuine user data.

This step is to look over our empathy research and start to define personas, stories and a problem statement.

### User stories

I have two user types at the moment, the buyer and the seller. I will cut down the stories to the reworked MVP model. So no categories and search, however there will be additional stories specifically for this version. <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/willforsyth.co.uk/document/d/1LVnqsOUnnbs-u5wwM3TfdB9EftUlVzhZ8cQ3ojk0ZRQ/edit?usp=sharing" title="Link to google docs of user stories">Full list</a>

### Personas

I selected a few key users and completed several personas. To try and put myself into their shoes to find out some key traits.

### Empathy diagram

Using the interviews and key personas I then completed several empath diagrams to did a little deeper into the feelings and frustrations.

> ### Problem statement
> As a sneaker head, I want to buy and sell exclusive genuine products, to a community of like minded people, securely and safely.

### Affinity Diagramming &amp; Card Sorting

This style of affinity diagram takes on the more of the Design thinking style, where we add everything I have found so far, quotes from users, sketches I have made any key user stories and ideas.

### User story mapping

I gathered all of our research and mapped out stories to show how the buyer and seller would reach their goals.

### How might we

Some key how might we discussion points. These are some possible questions that we need to solve.

- How might we ensure genuine products
- How might we create a community
- How might we ensure all transactions are safe and secure
- How might we make it exclusive
- How might we stop the need for queuing
- How might we get good photography
