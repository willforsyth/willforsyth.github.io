 Step 1 in the journey. UX research to get a MVP up as early as possible.
---
If your not up to speed read this [how the journey started](/ux/2017/03/17/how-not-to-launch-a-product.html) first. This is step 1 in my process of creating a MVP with the only objective to test the market, get some genuine user data. To allow the idea to go full steam ahead, pivot or ditch.

This step is about basing most of my decisions on assumptions. I can then get a MVP out there ASAP to test. Ideally I would carry out usability testing on a story board or click through prototype at the end of this research phase.

## The research
At this stage I can't do any usability testing, or any testing on users. I will revisit this research phase once I have a MVP.

> ### Research I am leaving till I have a MVP
> * Contextual Enquiry
> * Surveys
> * User Interviews
> * Usability test
> * Customer feedback


### Stake holder interviews
This would be the time to hold workshops and create a engagement with the product owners and people working on the product once live. I have held several of these at early stages of projects and they are always highly beneficial. For this one I guess I am the only stakeholder on this project.

#### Project vision

**Q:** What is your vision for this offering? <br/>
**A:** To create a safe secure place for people to sell products, with little or no fees. Create a safe community of sellers and buyers. Sell a small amount of high end items. The large sites often sell fakes and people donâ€™t have faith in them. I am going to start out selling limited edition sneakers.

**Q:** What defines success for this project? <br/>
**A:** Getting users and creating a trusted community.

**Q:** What are the potential pitfalls (i.e. what keeps you up at night about this project)? <br/>
**A:** No uses it and payment security.

> ### Finding so far from interviews: USP
> * Only sells genuine products.
> * No or very little fees to buy and sell.
> * Rare and limited edition products only. ( Starting with sneakers )


### Competitive Analysis

I picked some direct and indirect competitors to document and study. [View the document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11fK2-9nBzn0oN0x-hrgNJjYc7ql1Bc1Vk4xFQHcay98/edit?usp=sharing)

### User stories
I have two user types at the moment, the buyer and the seller. I will cut down the stories to the reworked MVP model. So no categories and search, however there will be additional stories specifically for this version. <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/willforsyth.co.uk/document/d/1LVnqsOUnnbs-u5wwM3TfdB9EftUlVzhZ8cQ3ojk0ZRQ/edit?usp=sharing" title="Link to google docs of user stories">Full list</a>

### Personas
I selected a few key users and completed several personas. This helped me to put myself into their shoes and to find out some key traits.
