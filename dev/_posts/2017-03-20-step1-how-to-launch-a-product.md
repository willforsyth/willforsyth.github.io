 Step 1 in the journey. UX research to get a MVP up as early as possible.
---
If your not up to speed read this [how the journey started](/ux/2017/03/17/how-not-to-launch-a-product.html) first. This is step one in creating a MVP and getting some real data.

This step is about basing most of my decisions on assumptions. I can then get a MVP out there ASAP to test. Ideally I would carry out usability testing on a story board or click through prototype at the end of this research phase.

## The research
At this stage I can't do any usability testing, or any testing on users. I will revisit this research phase once I have a MVP.

> ### Research I am leaving till I have a MVP
> * Contextual Enquiry
> * Surveys
> * User Interviews
> * Usability test
> * Customer feedback


### Stake holder interviews
This would be the time to hold workshops and create a engagement with the product owners and people working on the product once live. I have held several of these at early stages of projects and they are always highly beneficial. For this one I guess I am the only stakeholder on this project.

#### Project vision

**Q:** What is your vision for this offering? <br/>
**A:** To create a safe secure place for people to sell products, with little or no fees. Create a safe community of sellers and buyers. Sell a small amount of high end items. The large sites often sell fakes and people donâ€™t have faith in them. I am going to start out selling limited edition sneakers.

**Q:** What defines success for this project? <br/>
**A:** Getting users and creating a trusted community.

**Q:** What are the potential pitfalls (i.e. what keeps you up at night about this project)? <br/>
**A:** No uses it and payment security.

> ### Finding so far from interviews: USP
> * Only sells genuine products.
> * No or very little fees to buy and sell.
> * Rare and limited edition products only. ( Starting with sneakers )


### Competitive Analysis

I picked some direct and indirect competitors to document and study. [View the document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11fK2-9nBzn0oN0x-hrgNJjYc7ql1Bc1Vk4xFQHcay98/edit?usp=sharing)
