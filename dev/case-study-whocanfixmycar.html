        <li>2) User finds the garage profile.</li>

                <h3>Sketches</h3>
                <p>First step once we have a problem statement is to sketch out some user flows and possible journeys and rough ideas. I would often at this point try to create some prototypes with paper to test out different ways to approach the process.</p>

            <header>
              <h3>Interaction flow</h3>
              <p>Once decided on a process I started to plan out in more detail how the user will input data, complete the booking and move through the process.</p>
              <blockquote>"I tried to stick to the core user journeys, time permitting I would investigate other journeys further."</blockquote>

              <h3>Wireframes</h3>
              <p>Next I looked at wireframing the different screen states. This shows the user flows in more detail including notes on how the interactions would work. Time permitting I would go into more detail with the labeling and documentation.</p>
              <ul>Key features of new structure
                <li>Tap bar to access elements of form.</li>
                <li>Estimate cost for selected services.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I then created a click through prototype using <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/" title="">invision</a>. This iteration only takes in one flow, ideally I would expand this to make a full prototype to test.</p>
              <blockquote>"If the garage has no way to show available times then the user could select any time and the garage would confirm the appointment."</blockquote>

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>I then added some design styles to the wireframes and started to build up the steps in a little more detail. I have changed some of the colours slightly to modernise the colour pallette. </p>
            <p>I like to supply an example animation using <a href="http://principleformac.com/" title="">principle</a> to help demonstrate how the interactions could work. This makes the hand over easier to explain.</p>
            <ul>Key features of new design
              <li>Refresh of colour and styles used.</li>
              <li>Introduction of illustrations.</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>“If you were looking for a brand refresh in the future you may want to have bespoke illustrations created depending on the direction of new brand styles.”</blockquote>

              <h3>Next steps</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>More research into the user goals and a problem statements to decide on extra flows.</li>
                <li>Validation and error handling.</li>
                <li>Test <b>This week</b> and <b>Next week</b> do we need to add in more options?</li>
                <li><b>A/B test</b> the order of the start of the form."</li>
                <li>Usability tests.</li>
