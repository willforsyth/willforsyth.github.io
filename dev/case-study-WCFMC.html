        <li>2) User finds the garage profile.</li>

            <h3>Ways to tackle the issue</h3>
          </header>
          <p>We would need to carry out research into this area and find out why this is happening.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Google analytic monitoring and study.</li>
              <li>Run some online usability tests and give them a basic task to contact / organise an appointment with the garage.</li>
              <li>Add in a form to ask the user if they have found what they want / what they are looking for on this page.</li>
              <li>Carry out some interviews with customers to find out some key information.
                  <ul>
                    <li>How do they normally book an appointment with a garage</li>
                    <li>Do they know what they want when they contact a garage?</li>
                    <li>Do they know what the issue is with their car when they contact a garage. IE is it a unknow issue or do they need a service or MOT. If it’s a unknow issue would they want to diagnose the issue to get a rough idea of cost or would they be happy to book a time for a diagnosis?</li>
                    <li>Do they feel more comfortable speaking to a mechanic or the garage to discuss the issue?</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>From this we could get a better understanding of the reason for people visiting this page and how we can improve the whole garage experience. If they are visiting this page so they can find out more about the garage get some reviews and then find contact details to talk to someone how can we give them a better experience.</p>

      </header>
          <p>The research phase follows the same process as the earlier phase but we now have more information to work with since we can analysis the new site.</p>
          <h4>What we used</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Competitor research</b> confused.com, gocompare.com etc </li>
            <li><b>Analytics research</b> ...</li>
            <li><b>Surveys and questionnaires</b> ...</li>
            <li><b>User stories</b> ...</li>
            <li><b>User personas</b> we had some real personas now to work with</li>

          <h3>1.2 | UX analysis</h3>
        </header>
              <p>We analysed the data and using a User story map and affinity diagrams we started to build up a nice understanding of what we would like to include.</p>

              <h4>User story map</h4>
              <p>This gave us the full picture of the feature. We had one backbone of the big activity, the one under are the steps for each activity to be completed and then under are the details in each step.</p>
              <h4>Findings</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Car finance</b> we would call it car finance and it would be it's own dedicated section.</li>
                <li><b>Comparison table</b> unique comparison table that can filter by car registration plates.</li>
                <li><b>Quick quote</b>, <b>Vehicle valuation</b>, <b>Dedicated wisdom content</b>, <b>Car finance calculator</b>, <b>Benefits section</b>, <b>Email / Save results</b>, <b>Car cost estimator</b>, <b>Garage and car search</b></li>
              </ul>
              <p>We could then prioritise features into releases</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Must have</b> Quick quote, Dedicated wisdom content, Benefits section, Comparison table</li>

                <p>Not we had the "must have's" it's time to revisit the personas and create user flows to plan out every point of contact.</p>
                <img src="/imgs/user-flow.png" title="">
                <h4>User flows</h4>
                <p>This user flows is based on the first persona Phil, it shows his full process of touch points, from when he fills in a quick form on the home page to when he hits reply and fills in a modal. When outlining the flow it's important to include all touch points and keep it as simple and intuitive as possible, include notifications and call to actions to help the flow.</p>
                <img src="/imgs/interaction-flow.png" title="">
                <h4>Interaction design | Comparison table</h4>
                <p>This detailed interaction design shows the process of pressing apply on a comparison result and then having to fill in a modal with selections</p>
                <img src="/imgs/user-flow-car-value.png" title="">
                <h4>Interaction design | Car valuation</h4>
                <p>This shows part of the Car valuation interaction, how the user inputs his details and how we can gather data and get him to his goal as quickly as possible.</p>
