    <h3>Money Guru | Client overview</h3>
    <p>Money guru is a comparison site that went from 0 - 180k monthly users in its first few months and became the fasted growing comparison website in the UK in 2017. I lead the user-centric approach to user research, analysis, ux design and ui design. We continually monitor and improve the experience based on user research.</p>
    <p>I am going to give a brief overview of the initial release and then focus on a later release to show a more detailed process.</p>

              <li><b>Analytics research</b> We had the original site ukloans to base gather our analytic data from. Not the best but this was enough to start until we had a MVP.</li>
              <li><b>Surveys and questionnaires</b> We added hotjar to the site to gather as much data as we could on the users behaviours. This monitored all types of user interaction and allowed us to add surveys and polls to the site.</li>
              <li><b>User stories</b> These are my first point of call and we wrote over 100 user stories to delve into what the users needs were.</li>
              <li><b>User personas</b> Were used to study in depth key stories and find out what issues and goals they have.</li>

                  <li><b>Sketch</b> is my software of choice as it's has lots of functionality to speed up the design process.</li>
                  <li><b>Marvel app</b> I used Marvel and principle to create prototypes, however, as a front end developer I can quickly code HTML, CSS and Javascript prototypes</li>

          <p>The research phase follows the same process as the earlier phase but we now have more information to work with since we can analysis the new site.</p>

            <li><b>Competitor research</b> confused.com, gocompare.com etc </li>

              <p>We analysed the data and using a User story map and affinity diagrams we started to build up a nice understanding of what we would like to include.</p>

              <h4>Findings</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Car finance</b> we would call it car finance and it would be it's own dedicated section.</li>
                <li><b>Comparison table</b> unique comparison table that can filter by car registration plates.</li>
                <li><b>Quick quote</b>, <b>Vehicle valuation</b>, <b>Dedicated wisdom content</b>, <b>Car finance calculator</b>, <b>Benefits section</b>, <b>Email / Save results</b>, <b>Car cost estimator</b>, <b>Garage and car search</b></li>

                <p>Not we had the "must have's" it's time to revisit the personas and create user flows to plan out every point of contact.</p>

                <h4>User flows</h4>
                <p>This user flows is based on the first persona Phil, it shows his full process of touch points, from when he fills in a quick form on the home page to when he hits reply and fills in a modal. When outlining the flow it's important to include all touch points and keep it as simple and intuitive as possible, include notifications and call to actions to help the flow.</p>

                <h4>Interaction design | Comparison table</h4>
                <p>This detailed interaction design shows the process of pressing apply on a comparison result and then having to fill in a modal with selections</p>

                <h4>Interaction design | Car valuation</h4>
                <p>This shows part of the Car valuation interaction, how the user inputs his details and how we can gather data and get him to his goal as quickly as possible.</p>
